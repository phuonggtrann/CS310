//This class represents a "connection" in a network (e.g. a wired connection,
//a bluetooth connection, etc. depending on the network structure). It is
//complete and you do not need to edit it for this project.

//If you are interested, this class contains two "patterns" common in
//software development: (1) generating unique ids per instance and
//(2) creating a "factory" that creates instances.
